# WebSocket-based-vedio-streaming
WebSocket Video Streaming Project:
Overview:
	This project aims to implement a real-time video streaming solution using WebSocket communication. It includes both server and client-side code for streaming video frames over a network. The server captures video frames from a webcam and sends them to connected clients, while the client receives and displays the video in real-time.

Features:
	Utilizes Python, OpenCV, and WebSocket technology for video streaming.
	Server-side implementation captures video frames and sends them to connected clients.
	Client-side implementation receives and displays the streaming video.
	Threading is used for concurrent video capturing and streaming.
